# hyperledger-oss-progress

Hyperledger OSS Learning progress repo has been created for tracking the progress of the team and keeping everyone in sync with the rest of the members.

Check Repo [Projects](https://github.com/sahaparamjit/hyperledger-oss-progress/projects) for the progress tracking.

Progress tracker can be made by creating a ToDo note and add some checklist on it. 

When you start working on the todo list move the note to in progress and once you complete your checklist keep on adding tick marks on your it.


**Note:** This repo will not be maintained for long term. This has been created because most of us are new to blockchain technologies. Once we start contributing to the Fabric project and we find we no longer need a progress tracking system for our contribution, we will make this repo as read only project.
